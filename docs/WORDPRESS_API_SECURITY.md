# Security Recommendations for WordPress API Endpoints

This document outlines security recommendations for the `/api/analyze-html` and `/api/convert-to-wordpress` endpoints.

## 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Importance:** To prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), HTML injection, and other injection attacks that could compromise the user's browser or the server.
- **Recommendations:**
    - **Validate HTML Structure:** Before processing, ensure the incoming HTML is well-formed. Use a robust HTML parser to validate the structure.
    - **Sanitize HTML Content:**
        - If the HTML content is to be rendered or processed in a way that could execute scripts, use a library to sanitize it. Remove or escape any `<script>` tags, event handlers (e.g., `onclick`, `onerror`), and potentially harmful CSS (e.g., `url()` with `javascript:`).
        - Define an allowlist of acceptable HTML tags and attributes if possible.
    - **Validate Theme Options:** For the `/api/convert-to-wordpress` endpoint, validate all theme options (name, description, version). Ensure they don't contain malicious characters or overly long strings that could cause issues.
    - **JSON Schema Validation:** For all JSON request bodies, define and enforce a strict JSON schema. Reject any requests that do not conform to the schema.

## 2. Protection Against Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

- **Importance:** If these endpoints make requests to other internal or external services based on user-provided data (e.g., fetching resources specified in the HTML), SSRF could allow attackers to make arbitrary requests from the server.
- **Recommendations:**
    - **Avoid Direct URL Input:** Do not allow users to directly provide URLs that the server will fetch.
    - **Allowlist Domains/IPs:** If requests to other services are necessary, maintain a strict allowlist of permissible domains or IP addresses.
    - **Validate and Sanitize URLs:** If URLs are derived from input, ensure they are well-formed and do not use unexpected protocols (e.g., `file://`, `ftp://`).
    - **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the services handling these API requests from critical internal systems.

## 3. Rate Limiting

- **Importance:** To prevent abuse, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and brute-forcing attempts.
- **Recommendations:**
    - **Implement IP-based Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of requests an IP address can make to these endpoints within a specific time window (e.g., X requests per minute).
    - **Consider User-based Rate Limiting (if applicable):** If users are authenticated, apply rate limits per user account.
    - **Exponential Backoff:** Implement exponential backoff for clients that exceed rate limits.
    - **Monitor for Abuse:** Log and monitor request patterns to identify and block abusive IPs.

## 4. Authentication and Authorization (If Applicable)

- **Importance:** If these endpoints perform sensitive operations, generate user-specific content, or consume significant server resources, they should be protected.
- **Recommendations:**
    - **API Keys/Tokens:** For machine-to-machine communication or third-party integrations, use API keys or tokens with appropriate permissions.
    - **User Authentication:** If these services are part of a larger application with user accounts, ensure that only authenticated users can access them.
    - **Authorization Checks:** Verify that the authenticated user or client has the necessary permissions to perform the requested operation (e.g., generate a theme). This is particularly important if there are different user roles or subscription tiers.

## 5. Proper Error Handling

- **Importance:** To avoid leaking sensitive information (e.g., stack traces, internal file paths, database details) that could aid attackers.
- **Recommendations:**
    - **Generic Error Messages:** Return generic, non-detailed error messages to the client for server-side errors (e.g., "An internal server error occurred," "Failed to process the request").
    - **Detailed Logging:** Log detailed error information (including stack traces) on the server-side for debugging purposes. Ensure these logs are protected and not accessible to users.
    - **HTTP Status Codes:** Use appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the nature of the error (e.g., `400 Bad Request` for invalid input, `500 Internal Server Error` for server issues).
    - **Do Not Reflect User Input in Errors:** Avoid directly reflecting user-supplied data in error messages without proper sanitization, as this can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

## 6. Content Security Policy (CSP)

- **Importance:** While primarily a client-side protection, if the API serves HTML directly or influences HTML generation, ensuring it's compatible with strict CSPs is beneficial.
- **Recommendations:**
    - **Avoid Inline Scripts/Styles:** Generate HTML that avoids inline JavaScript (`<script>...</script>` or `onclick="..."`) and inline styles (`style="..."`) where possible, favoring external resources. This makes it easier to implement a strong CSP on the front-end.

## 7. Dependency Management

- **Importance:** Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used for HTML parsing, sanitization, or ZIP file creation can expose the endpoints.
- **Recommendations:**
    - **Regularly Scan Dependencies:** Use tools like `npm audit` or Snyk to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    - **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Update libraries to their latest secure versions.

By implementing these recommendations, the security posture of the `/api/analyze-html` and `/api/convert-to-wordpress` endpoints can be significantly improved. Regular security reviews and penetration testing are also advised.
